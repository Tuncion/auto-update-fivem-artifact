# Auto Update FiveM Artifact

This is a simple script that will automatically update your FiveM server artifact. I just write this for myself and I thought I would share it with you guys.\
Feel free to open a Pull Request if you have any improvements or bug fixes. I will be happy to merge them ❤️\
Create a Issue with the `bug` label if you have any issues. I will try to fix them as soon as possible.

## How to use
Please make sure you have NodeJS installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).\
**Do not update while the server is running. It will cause issues.**

1. Run dependency.bat to install the dependencies.
2. Edit the config.json file to your liking.
3. Run the utils/<your-os>/start.* file to start the script.
4. Enjoy! :)
